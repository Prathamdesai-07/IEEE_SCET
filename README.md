In this Repo, we have implemented the DeepLabV3+ with the ResNet50 model from scratch. With the Batch size of 8, Image Size of 512, 512. 

**Pre Processing**: We have implemented the function to convert the masks to binary and dilated masks and for the images we have done Histogram Equlization and smoothing with Gaussian blur. We haven't implemented the Augmentation task as we had a sufficient amount of images.

**Dataset**: In the given code we have used a dataset provided on the Kaggle by [Tushar Tendulka](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushartalukder/nuclei-256), In which there are to 1340 files having various images consisting cancer cell and their masks. Which is derived from the original dataset of PanNuke. We have used 603, 91, and 67 for Training, Validation, and Test respectively. In the said dataset we haven't got the Labels for the said classes in the original dataset of PanNuke. And then we've created the pipeline for all three types.

**Convolution Block Class**: The code defines a `ConvBlock` class as a Keras Layer, encapsulating common CNN operations. It incorporates a 2D convolutional layer (`Conv2D`) with customizable filters, kernel size, dilation rate, and bias usage. Optional batch normalization and activation functions (e.g., ReLU) can follow the convolution, determined by the boolean `batch` parameter. The block configuration allows flexible adjustment of filter count, kernel size, dilation rate, and activation function, with an additional flag for enabling batch normalization. This class facilitates the creation of convolutional layers in neural network architectures, providing versatility in configuring and combining these essential operations within a concise code structure.

**DSPP Layer**: This layer employs average pooling and dilated convolutions at varying rates, controlled by parameters like `kernel_1` and `dil1`. By concatenating results along the channel axis and processing them through a convolutional block, it enhances the DeepLabv3+ model's feature extraction. The layer focuses on capturing contextual information at diverse receptive field sizes, improving the model's capacity to recognize objects of different scales in input images. Configured with parameters such as input layer, kernel sizes, and dilation rates, it is tailored for optimized semantic segmentation performance.

**Metrics**: The `dice_coef` function calculates the Dice coefficient, a measure of similarity between predicted and true positive regions. The `dice_coef_loss` function provides the corresponding loss. Additionally, the `Jaccard` function computes the Jaccard coefficient, a metric assessing the overlap between predicted and true binary masks. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the accuracy and quality of segmentation models, aiding in the optimization process during training. Higher values signify better agreement between predicted and ground truth segmentations.

**Model**: This segmentation model modifies the ResNet50 architecture for image segmentation, integrating a Dilated Spatial Pyramid Pooling layer for contextual insights. It blends features from different ResNet blocks, utilizes convolutional blocks for feature processing, and employs upsampling for image resolution adjustment. The final layer generates a binary segmentation mask. The model is compiled with Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and tracks metrics like Dice coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and accuracy. A custom callback enables visualization of predictions during training. Tailored for semantic segmentation tasks, the model is designed for images of size IMG_SIZE.

**Test Predictions:** The code evaluates the segmentation model's predictions on a subset of the validation dataset. It calculates and visualizes binary masks using different threshold values. Additionally, it randomly selects three test samples and displays the original image, the ground truth mask, and the model's predictions with two distinct thresholds. The Dice and Jaccard coefficients are computed and shown for each prediction. This analysis aids in assessing the model's performance and understanding the impact of threshold variations on segmentation results.
